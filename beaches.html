<p>This beach is regarded as one of the most famous locations for being a surfer's paradise.The best time to visit such a beach would be from May-September when the monsoon has passed
    It has a wide range of restaurants and hotels for visitors to enjoy their experience.If surfing is not your activity then you can go for a 2 hour lsgoon safari
    where even Elephants and other wildlife can be spotted.Another exciting encoutner would be to climb Elephant Rock which is at the end of the beach . 
    A great hotel to stay at would be <a href="https://whiskypointresort.com/" class="link">Whisky point resort</a>.

<img src="images/Kalkudah_Beach.webp" alt="Kalkudah beach" width="600" height='350'>    
</figure>
<p>This beach is located 34km   north West of Batticloa .It currently doesn't have many luxury hotels or restaurants so it is possible for the visitor 
    to have a quiet getaway.It's close to the upmarket and populated Passikudah beach but doesn't have many visitors.It's one of the few beaches 
    to have a quiet sunbathe.however as most hotels are situated closer to Passikudah our recommend resort is <a href="https://www.karpahasands.com/" class="link">Karpaha Sands</a>
