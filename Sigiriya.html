        <img src="images/sigiriyapg2.webp" alt="Sigiriya" width="400" height="250" class="imgleft">
        <p class="history">In 477AD when king Kashyapa 1st seized the throne from his father with the assistance of the army chief,the correct heir fled to India fearful of 
death.Kashyapa then moved the capital and operated from the rock of Sigiriya,fearing the correct heir(Mogallana) would bring an army from India.
As he moved his capital to Sigiriya,it was transformed into a palace.However after Mogallana came back and Kashyapa took his own life,Sigiriya was 
transformed into a Buddhist monastery complex(according to wiki).</p>
