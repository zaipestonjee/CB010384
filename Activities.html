<P>Sri Lanka has a wide variety of safari's ranging from park safari's to even water safari's.
    The most common and needed safari for any visitor to experience would be to go to any national park with Lanka having
    over 26 national parks.However the most recommended experience would be to proceed on a safari in the yala national park.
    However when going for such an experience it is recommended to have a park tracker who is friendly and shows the beauty of our national 
    park.For most parks in Sri lanka, the price for entry is <i>(15$ +8$)</i>.When staying in a hotel close to a national park,most of them provide
    services for vehicle hire in national parks.For time of a safari it is recommended to have a 2-4 hour safari depending on sightings as any longer
    would be a bit tiring to the traveller.<br>

        <img src="images/adams-peak1.webp" alt="adams peak picture" width="600" id="img2">
    </figure> 
<p> The most recommended taken by hikers would be Adam's Peak here.It is a 2243m climb which takes around 2-5 hours depending
on your fitness.When u finish the trek to the top , there is a temple at the top which also requires you to remove your shoes.However when ascending
this mountain you may see the beautiful and stunning mountaneous views from the mountain. As most people aim to be on top of the mountain for the sunrise 
it is recommended to start the trek at 2am to have a breathtaking view of the sunrise.</p>
